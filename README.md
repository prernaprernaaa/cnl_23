Codes from Summer Internship 2023 at Cellular Neurophysiology Lab, MBU, IISc, Bangalore


These codes were written to simulate neuronal dynamics in the simulator NEURON. The passive modelling folder is for passive neurons (no active ion channels), and the active modelling folder is for Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. These simulations were then further used to analyse the effects of different biophysical properties on neuronal dynamics.
